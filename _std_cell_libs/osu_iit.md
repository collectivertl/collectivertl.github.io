James Stine led the development of standard cell development libraries at Illinois Institute of Technology, and those libraries followed him to Oklahoma State University.  These libraries support 0.5um, 0.35um, 0.25um, and 0.18um and are only free for educational use, and require license for commercial use.

OSU also contributed to the development of [FreePDK45](../freePDK).
