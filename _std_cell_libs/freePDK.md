FreePDK doesn't seem entirely open but has some later technology support.

## FreePDK15

[FreePDK15](https://www.eda.ncsu.edu/wiki/FreePDK15:Contents) was developed by North Carolina State in collaboration with MentorGraphics.  The FreePDK15 is licensed under the New BSD License.

## FreePDK45

Oklahoma State University and North Carolina State University jointly developed the [FreePDK45](https://www.eda.ncsu.edu/wiki/FreePDK45:Contents) standard cell library.  OSU indicates an educational use only license but NCSU shows that it should be under the Apache License, but the code is not openly posted.

## FreePDK3D45

[FreePDK3D45](https://www.eda.ncsu.edu/wiki/FreePDK3D45:Contents) isn't really a standard cell library but may be of interest to some that are interested in stacked dies.

## Notes

- OSU has a license model that prevents commercial use.  The NCSU site says it is published under the Apache license.
- NCSU seems to require a registration to be able to download the design kit, which doesn't sound very New BSD like.
